# KGA Arcade Game Conventions

This project is a static arcade with standalone game pages. Each student's game is a self-contained page.

## Adding a New Game

1. **Registry**: Add an entry to [src/games.ts](src/games.ts) with: `name`, `grade`, `teacher`, `emoji`, `slug`
2. **Route**: Create [src/routes/games/<slug>.tsx](src/routes/games/) - the file name must match the slug

## Game Structure

- Games are self-contained. No shared game state.
- Use `localStorage` for any state that needs to persist (scores, progress, etc.)
- Use existing shadcn/ui components from [src/components/ui/](src/components/ui/)
- No dynamic/server-side features - everything is statically built

## Example Entry

```typescript
{
  name: 'Adele',
  grade: '4th',
  teacher: 'Mrs. Studioso',
  emoji: '🐵',
  slug: 'adele',
}
```

## Routing

- Home page: `/` - card grid linking to all games
- Game pages: `/games/<slug>` - each game at its own URL
- Layout: All games share a layout with "Back to Home" link
